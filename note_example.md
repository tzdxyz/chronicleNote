It only takes ten seconds to crush a man's ambitions. I need take care and protect mine.

This morning, while playing badminton, I felt finding myself after a long time. Is there some way to keep the feeling of concentrating like this?

The work pressure is so immense. That makes me choose self-isolation.

I feel becoming more and more like Dad. 
Mom, I want to keep some distance from you.

I sold my macbook. 
If those things didn't happen, how would I be right now?

1. Practice and simulation are crucial because they can uncover the blind spot in theory.
2. My boss's mindset is to start from simplicity and progress towards complexity. 
3. Recent work is about research of electromagnetic dynamics.

I tried to make me follow the rules. Maybe the rules are right, but I just cannot accept them. 
I have to be submissive to my leader's order, as I need the salary to sustain my lifehood.

But are all these shits necessary?

> Entirely taken up by the present, I could remember nothing; I had no distinct notion of myself as a person, nor had I the least idea of what had just happened to me. I did not know who I was, nor where I was; I felt neither pain, fear, nor anxiety. I watched my blood flowing as I might have watched a stream, without even thinking that the blood had anything to do with me. I felt throughout my whole being such a wonderful calm, that whenever I recall this feeling I can find nothing to compare with it in all the pleasures that stir our lives.

> HAPPINESS is a permanent condition, which does not seem designed for man, while here below. Everything on earth is in a state of continual fluctuation, which will not permit anything to maintain a constant form. Every object with which we are surrounded, changes; we are equally mutable, nor can any man be certain he shall love tomorrow what he loves today: thus all our plans for happiness in this life, are purely chimerical. Let us, then, prize contentment whenever it offers; let us beware how we banish it by our own folly, neither let us embarrass ourselves with forming projects to ensure its continuance, since such projects are certain follies; I have seen few men, perhaps none, in a state of happiness; but I have seen many content, and of all the objects that ever struck me, it is that which conveys the greatest satisfaction to my heart, and I believe this is a natural consequence of the great power of involuntary sensation on my internal feelings.
